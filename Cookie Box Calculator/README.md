# Cookie Box Calculator Program

## Licence
This is a summary from chat gpt. It is also an assignment from Queens University that I am not taking credit for or plagerising.

## Overview
This program was developed for a local bakery to help them calculate the cost and pricing of their cookie boxes based on the box dimensions they provide. The program computes the manufacturing cost of the box, the number of cookies that can fit inside, the cost of ingredients for the cookies, and the total cost, including a recommended sale price with a 10% profit margin.

## Features
Input Dimensions: The user enters the length, width, and height of the cookie box in centimeters.
Cost Calculations:
Cardboard cost: Calculated using the surface area of the box.
Cookie fitting: The number of cookies that fit into the box is computed, considering that each cookie is a cylinder.
Cookie cost: The cost of ingredients is calculated based on the volume of the cookies.
Total cost: The total cost to produce the box of cookies is computed.
Selling price: The final selling price is determined, including a 10% profit margin.

## Usage
Run the program and enter the dimensions of the cookie box when prompted.
The program will output the manufacturing cost, number of cookies, total cost, and the recommended sale price.
Ensure the dimensions provided allow for at least 1 cookie to fit in the box.
