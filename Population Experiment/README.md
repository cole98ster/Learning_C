# Population Dynamics Experiment
This C program models the dynamics of a population through two experimental scenarios involving growth and decline rates. It provides insights into population behavior over time based on user-defined initial conditions.

## Features
### Initial Population Input:
User sets an initial population value between 100 and 500.
Includes validation to ensure input is within range.

### First Experiment:
Simulates population changes over 50 days.
Alternating growth (+66%) and decline (-50%) every third day.
Outputs the population after 50 days.

### Second Experiment:
Continues population simulation with a constant 16% daily decline.
Ends when the population falls below 100.
Outputs the number of days until this threshold is reached.
